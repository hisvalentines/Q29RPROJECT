				<h3>Enchanted Kingdom</h3>
				<p>EK is the first and only world-class theme park in the country. The theme park offers thrilling rides and kind-of Disneyland attractions. Going to Enchanted Kingdom would be so much fun if you have companions with you. Since Danah and Moody were in Manila at the time, I tagged them along in this magical adventure.</p>
